# ArmorAmiga "Wishmaster" PCB repository

This is an early prototype of ARM-based A1200 turbo board.

PCB design was created in [KiCAD EDA](https://kicad.org/).

It consists of the following parts:
 * Wishmaster carrier board
 * Alinx AC7010/AC7020 Xilinx Zynq development board (available on Aliexpress, for example: https://aliexpress.ru/item/4000585279066.html). Most likely, you will also need a Xilinx JTAG cable to work with it as a developer.
